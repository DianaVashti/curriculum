## Program Arc

I’m attempting to develop an arc to our program where we introduce divisible
parts of a modern web application one at a time, in isolation, before we ask
learners to bring these parts together. I’m seeing a lot of confusion around
what the divisible parts of a modern web application are and where their
borders lie. My hypothesis is: if we teach each part in isolation before asking
learners to use them in concert they will come away with a more clear picture
of how things fit together.

For example; rather than learning sql in the context of a todo list express
web app, we would introduce sql in isolation and ensure a certain level of
competency is met before adding the complexity of querying a sql server from
within a node program. We would also in-turn ensure learners master querying
a sql server in a simple node program before they’re asked to query a sql
server from within a more complicated node HTTP server program.

The ordering of skill groups in each phase (laid out below) is intended to
introduce individual concepts (sql, async programming, http, html & css, etc.)
in as low-complexity of a container as possible. Ensuring a certain level of
competency is met before adding to that complexity.
