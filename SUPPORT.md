## Individual Support

### Asking For Help

You can ask for help by putting a sticky note on your monitor or posting in
your phase slack channel with the tag `@phase-n-help`, where `n` is replaced
with the digit indicating your phase. You might want to do both since some
of our experts are in-house and some are remote.

#### Examples of what you can ask for

- help googling
- help getting unstuck
- clarity on the meaning of a listed skill
- help explaining a specific concept
- asking for a code review
- asking to be checked for having certain skills

### Talking Tech

…is an opportunity to practice explaining your code, the way you will be asked to do at [Phase Interviews](https://guide.learnersguild.org/Phases/Interviews/) (and also at interviews for software engineer positions). When you request a "Talking Tech" session with a Pro Coach or SEP at the end of a benchmark module, they will ask you questions about how your code works and why you chose to write it that way. The Pro Coach or SEP will also make sure you are comfortable with the relevant skills that start with "Can describe…".

### Async Code Reviews

…are conducted by an SEP to review your benchmark code and make sure you're on track, and to suggest improvements. You can request an async code review with a Github pull request or a Slack direct message to an SEP for your phase. 

## Phase Group Support

### Lectures

…are prepared talks given by an SEP on a specific topic. They're optional but
highly recommended.

Lectures are not on a set schedule. The SEP will announce the lecture topic at
morning announcements. In some cases the SEP might just poll you, the learners
in a phase, to find the most relevant topic to lecture on.


### Office Hours

…is a forum for you to ask any questions you want. They're also totally
optional. Unlike lectures the topics discussed are decided by the group in
attendance. We will cover more topics in less depth than a lecture.

#### Examples of what you can ask for

- explain skills in more detail
- live code a solution to the benchmark module


### Live Code Reviews

…are code reviews done by an SEP, of a learners code, in front of the whole
phase. This is intended to model to you, the learner, how a professional
programmer might critique your code. Giving the author(s) feedback in a forum
where everyone can ask questions.
