## Lectures

…are prepared talks given by an SEP on a specific topic. They're optional but
highly recommended.

Lectures are not on a set schedule. The SEP will announce the lecture topic at
morning announcements. In some cases the SEP might just poll you, the learners
in a phase, to find the most relevant topic to lecture on.


## Office Hours

…is a forum for you to ask any questions you want. They're also totally
optional. Unlike lectures the topics discussed are decided by the group in
attendance. We will cover more topics in less depth than a lecture.
