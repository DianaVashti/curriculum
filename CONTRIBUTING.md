## Nomenclature

I've been trying to avoid the word `Advanced` in the name of modules. Nothing
we teach here is "Advanced" in any skill area. When "leveling" modules try and
come up with context specific name but barring that, use the following naming
schema:

0. Foundational
0. TBD
0. TBD
0. TBD


## Modules


### Subsections

- Skill
- Exercises
- Search Terms
- Suggested Resources
  - Reading
  - Watching
- Glossary of Terms



## Open Questions

- How are learners are expected to contribute?
- How can learners make modules better?
- How will learners save their artifacts?
- How will learners track their progress?
  - What modules has a given learners completed?
  - What module is a learner working on now?
  - What skills do each learner believe they have?




## TODO

- balance phase 1 and 2
- adjust phase 1>2 & 2>3 assessments after re-balancing
