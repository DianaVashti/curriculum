## Nomenclature

I've been trying to avoid the word `Advanced` in the name of modules. Nothing
we teach here is "Advanced" in any skill area. When "leveling" modules try and
come up with context specific name but barring that, use the following naming
schema:

0. Foundational
0. TBD
0. TBD
0. TBD


## Big Open Questions

- Who will lead each Phase with only 2 SEPs?
- Are we still calling SEPs SEPs?
