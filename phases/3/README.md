# Phase 3

The Integrated Practice phase gives learners a chance to synthesize and utilize skills developed in Foundations 1 & 2 through module-based assignments and small projects that mimic real world applications.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learnâ€¦

- How to combine all of your `HTML and CSS`, `HTTP Server` and `Browser` skills together
- More JavaScript design patterns
- Full web application architecture
- How authentication works on most of the web
- Persisting web application state in a relational (SQL) database
- More advanced asynchronous patterns in JavaScript
- How to use Git and GitHub on a team
- How to render dynamically generated HTML

## Goal Library

In Phase 3, you'll work on goals from the goal library. Most of the goals are pairing goals, with a couple solo goals mixed in.

Here are the goals that you can choose from (ordered in rough approximation of increasing difficulty/complexity):
