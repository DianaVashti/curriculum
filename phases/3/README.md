# Phase 3

The Integrated Practice phase gives learners a chance to synthesize and utilize skills developed in Foundations 1 & 2 through module-based assignments and small projects that mimic real world applications.

In Phase 3, you'll vote on a goal(from the list of goals below) using Echo, and will be put on a team. Most of the goals are pairing goals, with a couple solo goals mixed in.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learnâ€¦

- How to combine all of your `HTML and CSS`, `HTTP Server` and `Browser` skills together
- More JavaScript design patterns
- Full web application architecture
- How authentication works on most of the web
- Persisting web application state in a relational (SQL) database
- More advanced asynchronous patterns in JavaScript
- How to use Git and GitHub on a team
- How to render dynamically generated HTML
- How to add migrations to your database schema
