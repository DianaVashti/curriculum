# Phase 4

## Description

The software field -- and indeed, the world at large -- owe a great deal to the open source software community. Like most developers, members of Learners Guild benefit daily from the availability of countless freely available software tools and educational resources. We are committed to contributing to these efforts and resources as committers to (and even maintainers of) open source projects.

In the **apprenticeship** phase, SEPs and learners will collaborate on contributions to OSS projects. SEPs will work with learners to identify appropriate issues to work on, and learners will be expected to submit pull requests to project maintainers.

## High Level Skills

- Looking under the hood: understanding how popular OSS tools work
- Being a good contributor: understanding OSS best practices
- Being able to adapt to the style of an existing codebase
- Using complex branching strategies
- Developing elegant, maintainable solutions to complex problems
- Devops for live production deployments

## Projects

SEPs will choose the projects to be worked on. These may be internal tools, or external projects.

Some examples of projects you may work on:

- LOS: echo, idm
- Ghost: https://github.com/tryghost/ghost
- Free Code Camp: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp
- React Toolbox: https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox

## Support

In phase 4, learners can expect to be working closely with an SEP throughout the week. SEPs will spend time pairing with learners on the development of solutions for issues in an OSS projectâ€™s repo (typically hosted on github). In the course of working on an open issue (either a bug fix, feature, or chore), SEPs will support learners in one or more of the following ways:

- Reviewing learners' code thoroughly, offering suggestions and feedback
- Doing live code reviews for all learners to observe and particpate in
- Providing guidance and assistance in problem solving via Slack
- Personally explaining concepts via Slack, video calls, and/or ad hoc whiteboarding sessions
- Demonstrating advanced problem solving
- Sharing resources for solo study

When a learner has a set of changes ready to be submitted to the project maintainers as a pull request, SEPs will also provide live and/or asynchronous code reviews as needed.

## Tracking

As with phases 1, 2, and 5, weekly (cycle-based) project tracking for learners in phase 4 will happen automatically in the background. The assigned goal will be a generic Phase 4 goal. These projects will have retro surveys, and learners will be expected to set a project artifact.
