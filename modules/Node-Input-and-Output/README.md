# Node Input and Output

In this module you'll learn how to read inputs and generate outputs in a node
program. The inputs we'll be covering are `command line arguments` and `STDIN`.
The outputs we'll cover are `STDOUT` and `STDERR`

## Skills

- can read arguments
- can read from STDIN
- can write to STDOUT
- can write to STDERR

## Search Terms

## Exercises

- Create a node program that prints the command line arguments given to it
- Create a node program that reads `STDIN` and writes it to `STDOUT`
- Create a node program that reads `STDIN` and outputs the number of lines
given.
