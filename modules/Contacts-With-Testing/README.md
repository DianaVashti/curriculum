# Contacts With Testing


add tests to all the methods on the contacts benchmark code using `console.assert`

- detailed test descriptions TBD

the `addContact` function should throw and error when given invalid data

the `addContacts` bulk add method should catch those errors and continue
to add further contacts and then printing warnings about failed imports
