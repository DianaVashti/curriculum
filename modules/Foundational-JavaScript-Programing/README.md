# Foundational JavaScript Programming

In this module we're going to cover some of the basics of general programming
as well as the basics of programming in JavaScript. You might have covered some
of this before you arrived at the guild but make sure you have these skills
before moving on from this module.

## Skills

### General Programming

- [ ] Can describe and use variables
- [ ] Can define both local and global variables
- [ ] Can describe the difference between local and global variables
- [ ] Can describe a function
- [ ] Can describe an Array
- [ ] Can describe a Hash / Index / Map
- [ ] Can turn any object into its Boolean equivalent
- [ ] Can sort an array by multiple conditions
- [ ] Can use the ! (bang) operator
- [ ] Using return as flow control
- [ ] Can read and write ternary statements
- [ ] Branching and Looping
- [ ] Can convert a Hash into an array of arrays [key, value], and back again
- [ ] Can convert an array of objects with unique property into a hash by that property

### JavaScript Specific

- [ ] Can declare local and global variables

- [ ] Can use an if / else statement
- [ ] Can use a switch statement
- [ ] Can use a while loop
- [ ] Can use a for loop
- [ ] Can define and use static functions
- [ ] Can explain when to use var
- [ ] Can explain operator precedence
- [ ] Can access object properties with both dot and bracket syntax
- [ ] Can get all the keys on an object
- [ ] Can use `Array#push`, `Array#pop`, `Array#shift`, `Array#unshift`
- [ ] Can use `Array#forEach`, `Array#map`, `Array#filter`, `Array#reduce`
- [ ] Can create and use closures
- [ ] Can pass multiple arguments into a function using a plain object
- [ ] Can explain lexical scope inheritance
- [ ] Can split a string into an array
- [ ] Can join an array into a string


## Glossary of Terms

### General Programming

| Term         | Explanation |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| String       | An ordered list of text characters |
| Number       | An object type representing either an Integer or a Float |
| Object       | A data structure |
| Array        | An array is an ordered set of values that you refer to with a name and an index. |
| Hash         | A data type mapping keys to values |
| Index        | AKA Hash |
| Map          | AKA Hash |
| Function     | A code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return an output. A function in JavaScript is also an object. |
| Boolean      | A logical data type that can have only the values true or false |
| Conditional  | A set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is true or not |
| Literal      | A way of declaring an object as it is literally meant to be interpreted |
| Truthy       | A value that translates to true when evaluated in a Boolean context |
| Falsy        | A value that translates to false when evaluated in a Boolean context |
| Comment      | A part of your source code that is ignored by the computed and is meant for other developers to read |
| Error        | An unindented event or outcome |
| Syntax Error | A error that is thrown when your source code is written incorrectly |

### JavaScript Specific

| Term           | Explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Number         | In JavaScript, Number is a numeric data type that can represent both an Integer and a Float |
| Object         | Almost all values in JavaScript are objects |
| ReferenceError | The error that is thrown when your code attempts to use something that was not declared |
