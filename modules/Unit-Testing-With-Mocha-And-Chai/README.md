## Exercises

- [ ] Follow along with the tutorial [Getting Started with Node.js and Mocha](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha) and write all the code (don't just copy-paste)
- [ ] Pick some Node.js code that you've written already and write a test suite for it. Make sure to test both expected inputs/outputs as well as unexpected/invalid inputs.
This module might be a good contender to have Learners download an existing snapshot of a simple project that has some test coverage, and have them complete test coverage (using existing tests as a model).
