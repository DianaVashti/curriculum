# Serialization

Serialization is the process of translating data structures into a format that
can be stored (for example, in a file) or transmitted (for example, across a
network connection) and reconstructed later.

In other words anytime you convert data (like objects, arrays, strings, numbers,
etc.) into a string that can be converted back into those same data strictures,
then you're serializing that data it.
