# Sorting Algorithms

In this module you'll be introduced to some sorting implementations, and the
built in JavaScript `Array.prototype.sort()` function.

## Exercises
- Implement the sorts (a skeleton file can be found [here](./index.js) for you to fill in the implementation)
    - Bubble sort
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
- Use `Array.prototype.sort()` to validate your implementation by comparing the results provided by your sorting implementations to the result of calling `sort()` on the inputs to your sorting implementations
