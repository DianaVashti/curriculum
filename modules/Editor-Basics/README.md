## Practice

Download either Atom or Sublime and use the resources above to help you complete the following tasks. To get started, use `mkdir` to create a new folder and `touch` a couple of new javascript files (for example: `test_file.js`). Add some basic lines of Javascript code so you can see your syntax highlighting once you install the package:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello World!')
}

sayHello()
```

1. [ ] Open your settings using the keyboard shortcut (`cmd-,`) and customize them to your liking
1. [ ] Install the package for Javascript syntax highlighting
1. [ ] Split your window vertically and horizontally to view two files at once
1. [ ] Toggle your side panel to either view or hide your file tree
1. [ ] Use `cmd-f` to find and replace text in the current file
1. [ ] Use `cmd-shift-f` to find and replace text across multiple files
1. [ ] Navigate to a new file in the same directory without using the file tree
1. [ ] Highlight the function name `sayHello` in the example. Use a keybaord command to select the other instance of `sayHello` in the file.
