# Clone Caviar

In this benchmark module is meant to help you practice everything you've learned
in phase 1. It's a tall order so don't be discouraged if this takes you a long
time to complete.

In this module you will be cloning a subset of the restaurant page of the food
ordering service [caviar](https://www.trycaviar.com/sf-east-bay/homeroom-151).

This module provides the SQL database for two fake restaurants. You need to make
a web application that serves.
