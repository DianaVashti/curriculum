# Adding `./node_modules/.bin` to your `$PATH`

When we install node modules with executable commands, like `mocha` or `babel`
we want to be able to just run `mocha` as apposed to `./node_modules/.bin/mocha`
so to enable this do the following:

1. Open your `~/.bashrc` in your editor
1. Add the line `export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"` to your `~/.bashrc` file
1. Close and re-open all of your shells for this to take affect

For more information on `$PATH` and how this works, see the
[Terminal Basics](../../../Terminal-Basics) module.
