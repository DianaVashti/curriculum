# Modules

Modules are intended to help you focus on acquiring a specific set of skills.
Each module starts with a list of specific skills and then provides resources,
search terms and exercises to help you acquire those skills.

As you go through a module stay focused on learning the specific skills listed
at the top.

Each module aims to support you in figuring out how to research, learn about
and practice the target set of skills. __Modules are not designed to teach you
the skills.__

Modules are meant to help you develop the meta-learning skills that will enable
you to use the Internet to research, learn and practice the skills you need
on your own.

An invaluable meta-skill required to become a successful software developer is
the ability to learn new skills on demand.

You won't stop learning after you leave the guild and begin your career. A daily
part of the job of a web developer will be researching and learning new skills.

So remember, while you're learning these skills you're also learning how to
teach yourself these kinds of skills in the future.
