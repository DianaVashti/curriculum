# Promises

In this module you'll learn about the use of Promises for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Skills
- can create a promise
    - understand how and when a promise is fulfilled by a value
    - understand how and when a promise is rejected with an exception
    - understand the executor - the argument passed to a new Promise
- can create a promise composition, using `then`
- can handle errors in a promise composition, using `catch`
- can convert a standard node callback into a Promise
- can use `Promise` static methods:
    - `.all()` to return a `Promise` that resolves when all of the promises in the provided iterable are resolved
    - `.race()` to return a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the provided iterable are resolved or rejected
    - `.reject()` to return a rejected `Promise`, with a reason
    - `.resolve()` to return a resolved `Promise`, with a value
