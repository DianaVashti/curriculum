# Promises

In this module you'll learn about the use of Promises for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Skills

- can use `.then` handle when a promise is fulfilled
- can use `.catch` to handle when a promise is rejected
- can explain when a promise is fulfilled or rejected
- can use `.then` to chain promises (promise composition)
- can use `.catch` to handle errors up a promise chain
- can create a `new Promise`
- can convert a function that uses callbacks into function that returns a Promise
- can use `Promise.all()` to return a `Promise` that resolves when all of the promises in the provided iterable are resolved
- can use `Promise.race()` to return a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the provided iterable are resolved or rejected
- can use `Promise.reject()` to return a rejected `Promise`, with a reason
