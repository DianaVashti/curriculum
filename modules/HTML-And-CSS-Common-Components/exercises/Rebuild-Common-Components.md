# Rebuild Common Components

Pick four components from
[Bulma](http://bulma.io/documentation/components/card/)
or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
or [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/) and reverse-engineer them
(i.e. build HTML & CSS to mimic what they look like).

Showcase your components in a file called `components.html` and write your CSS
in a `components.css` file.
