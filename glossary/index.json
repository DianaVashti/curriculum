  "AJAX": {
    "description": "AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a programming practice of combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM, and the XMLHttpRequest object to build more complex webpages.  What AJAX allows you to do is just update parts of a webpage instead of having to reload the entire page. AJAX also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code continues to run while that part of your webpage is trying to reload (compared to synchronously which will block your code from running until that part of your webpage is done reloading).",

    "description": "A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.\n\nBesides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying User-Agent HTTP header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.\n\nSpam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as user agent spoofing.\n\nThe user agent string can be accessed with JavaScript on the client side using navigator.userAgent.\n\nA typical user agent string looks like this: \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0\".
